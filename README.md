# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Thing I re-learned about coding while doing this:

* There is a gem called yarn (deprecated and irrelevant) and there is a node package called yarn (the one we want). Figuring out that I had the gem installed, needed to uninstall that and reinstall the node version took some time and energy. A familiar frustration, figuring out someone else's rules.

* Small things like the difference between '<% yield %>' and '<%= yield %>' are crucial to success as a developer. Attention to detail. In the above case, either everything appears or nothing appears. Quite a difference.

* 2FA introduces a new set of authentication issues that likewise took some time to figure out. Finally, though, we've hooked up our repo to github.


Possible current issues
- Not listening on the right $PORT (never set that up).
- Postgres not properly setup. Clearly not functioning properly on local.
- I think I'll need to create this rails app from new, connect it to GH, push some commits, etc. so I can START with it connected to postgres. Too much headache for me to work through at this hour. 

Order of operations to create + deploy a new app
- Make sure the computer itself is ready to be a dev environment (black box of error messages)
- `rails new app_name --database=postgresql` and don't forget that postgres action, otherwise you're fucked. 
- Give it version control with git ==> `git init` (maybe something more than that), then `stats` + `add` + `commit -m "first message`
    - You now have an app that exists in code on your computer and has version control. 
- To test that it's working cd in and use `rails s` to spin up a local server. If puma, yarn and everything else is installed correctly, then you should see the default Rails page. Nice. Now time to connect to Heroku.
- Heroku has 10 different things it wants you to do to setup existing applications. Follow their detailed instructions, which include creating a random instructional called a Procfile. 
- Things that aren't yet clear are the role of postgres on your local computer and what configuring I need to do with the env variable $PORT. I could start from scratch, or try and figure out what's wrong with the current app, which I think will be beneficial overall for my understanding of how things work.

Ok goodbye. Fuck you code. It shouldn't take me 3 hours to deploy something from scratch. Especially using Rails.
