# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Thing I re-learned about coding while doing this:

* There is a gem called yarn (deprecated and irrelevant) and there is a node package called yarn (the one we want). Figuring out that I had the gem installed, needed to uninstall that and reinstall the node version took some time and energy. A familiar frustration, figuring out someone else's rules.

* Small things like the difference between '<% yield %>' and '<%= yield %>' are crucial to success as a developer. Attention to detail. In the above case, either everything appears or nothing appears. Quite a difference.
