# README

The purpose of this project is to relearn the basics of coding. For today's purposes that is 
1. Creating the correct dev environment. 
2. Properly using VSCode. 
3. Successfully create a rails app on local environment. Change things around and display my own custom info on PORT 3000. 
4. Send that app up to heroku. 
5. Create a database that links to the app. 
6. Display data from the database.

Thing I re-learned about coding while doing this:

* There is a gem called yarn (deprecated and irrelevant) and there is a node package called yarn (the one we want). Figuring out that I had the gem installed, needed to uninstall that and reinstall the node version took some time and energy. A familiar frustration, figuring out someone else's rules.

* Small things like the difference between '<% yield %>' and '<%= yield %>' are crucial to success as a developer. Attention to detail. In the above case, either everything appears or nothing appears. Quite a difference.

* 2FA introduces a new set of authentication issues that likewise took some time to figure out. Finally, though, we've hooked up our repo to github.


Possible current issues
- Not listening on the right $PORT (never set that up).
- Postgres not properly setup. Clearly not functioning properly on local.
- I think I'll need to create this rails app from new, connect it to GH, push some commits, etc. so I can START with it connected to postgres. Too much headache for me to work through at this hour. 

Order of operations to create + deploy a new app
- Make sure the computer itself is ready to be a dev environment (black box of error messages)
- `rails new app_name --database=postgresql` and don't forget that postgres action, otherwise you're fucked. 
- Give it version control with git ==> `git init` (maybe something more than that), then `stats` + `add` + `commit -m "first message`
    - You now have an app that exists in code on your computer and has version control. 
- To test that it's working cd in and use `rails s` to spin up a local server. If puma, yarn and everything else is installed correctly, then you should see the default Rails page. Nice. Now time to connect to Heroku.
- Heroku has 10 different things it wants you to do to setup existing applications. Follow their detailed instructions, which include creating a random instructional called a Procfile. 
- Things that aren't yet clear are the role of postgres on your local computer and what configuring I need to do with the env variable $PORT. I could start from scratch, or try and figure out what's wrong with the current app, which I think will be beneficial overall for my understanding of how things work.

Ok goodbye. It shouldn't take me 3 hours to deploy something from scratch. Especially using Rails.

Well, somehow it worked. I just sent the thing up into the heroku universe and... it built. So. That's good. 

We're back in it.... Next step is to link this baby to a database. Imagined steps: 
 
- Initialize a database (local) 
- Initiatize tables (local)
- Initialize & migrate tables in heroku production. 
- Access the console. 
- Seed with all the correct data. 
    The correct data, Table Links:
        - link:string 
        - postDate: date
        - timestamps
        - title:string (may or may not use)
    (optional) The correct data, Table TagsLinks:
        - FK:link
        - FK:tag
        - timestamps
    (optional) The correct data, Table Tags: 
        - tagName:string
        - timestamps

- The above will give me step 1) a list of links postable by date and 2) the possibility of tagging.
    Example tags: 
        - Subject matter (horse, animal, education, niche)
        - Media type (video, article, interactive, twitter thread)
        - Website (YouTube, Reddit, independent, etc.)


With all that info, you can create a pretty nice little system. Fairly robust. Just need to figure out how to do this database migration. Going to read a few articles first. At the moment, just looking at the Rails Heroku page and the Rails Getting Started page. The Getting started page is optimized for a local environment so just want to be sure. Medium article time.

- Okay... so interesting. Just remembering the flow of things and what's required when doing database stuff. You start by creating a migration file. `rails generate model Link name:string` etc
- BUT I forgot that the table name is supposed to be plural.
- Wait wait wait no I did it correctly. You generate with singular in the terminal and then rails automatically get you ready to migrate in a plural table.
- Creating a join table `https://dev.to/neshaz/join-table-in-rails-23b5`
- And a little bit of this `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17765249/generate-migration-create-join-table`


- Okay, I went ahead and generated three models. The models will connect to three tables. The ones outlined above. Models were created. I had to manually modify them to add the joining relationship (`has_many` and `belongs_to`). And three migration files were automatically created. Next up is migrating all these bad boys in Heroku.
- Wait no not yet. First I need to take those files which i've created on my local computer and send them up to the Heroku dyno. `git add .` `git commit -m "models and migrations` `git push -u heroku main`
- now the code exists on the dyno and I can safely db:migrate. Let's do it `heroku run rake db:migrate`
- there is an SQLite file that is lingering, which is interesting.
- Okay I ran the migration. Everything SHOULD be up and running and it appears to be successful. Time to play around in the console.
- Time to create some data... `heroku pg:psql` - this allows me to access the console.
- Interesting, so now I have access to the datbase directly. But is that what I want? I'd rather access the console and create things via Link.new(). I want to go entirely through ActiveRecord speak. Ah okay -- `heroku run rails console` is what I need. I don't want to use SQL. I want ActiveRecord. Okay okay okay here we go great. 

- Alright, we're now in the console creating shit. ```Link.new(url: "https://wwww.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ", description: "rick roll'd", postDate: Date.parse('2021-06-16'))```
- Created our first record. Let's now display this thing. Working through the rails documentation, I then saved the new initialized object to the database and found it again via id. `link1.save` then `Link.find(1)` And there it is with its timestamps, etc. Game on. 

OKAY NEXT PHASE, display the data.

- We're entering the controller / view / erb area. I remember this, but only kind of. The key here is that to display things, you use `@`. That variable is the shared value between controller and view. Let's just do this thing.
- One issue I have now is that my controller is called "ArticlesController" but it should really be "LinksController" ––– I'll fix that in a bit. Eager to just see things appear on the page.
- Going to do this: `@first_link = Link.find(1)`
- Then going to reach inside that thing and pull out the url in views, I suppose. Interesting how the views handles an OBJECT. Seems like a bit of magic going on there.
- Okay, I've added this `<%= first_link.url %>` to my index page. Let's see what happens. Theoretically, this should work! 
- Nope... got over excited. It does not work. It compiled. Reloaded the page... then nothing.
here's the error message `at=info method=GET path="/" host=onelinktrta.herokuapp.com request_id=a08bb9d7-19aa-4dc6-9152-23a9878dce4e fwd="72.130.33.132" dyno=web.1 connect=1ms service=137ms status=500 bytes=1827 protocol=https` Which to me means I requested the page and there was a server error (500)... but nothing is specified. Ah, I see... I think. I didn't add `@` before first link above. But i'm not sure why that would constitue an issue? Maybe `Link.find(1)` isnt' correct? I did go off script there. 

- From the rails site: `The <%= %> tag means "evaluate the enclosed Ruby code, and output the value it returns."` So I'm assuming that the enclosed Ruby code just couldn't be evaluated without the `@`... Let's hope. 

- That was it! 

Alright, we've now displayed data from a database hosted by Heroku!

Now it'd be great to seed this thing with the correct data and display each link properly. Shouldn't be too hard.

Seeding a rails database is not part of the "getting started" article.
- `heroku run rake db:seed`
